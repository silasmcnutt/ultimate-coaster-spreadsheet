## Usage
Open [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15onFFuAuOKELhxUfLxsgUXvVWeR3p8IlAB8UARwpbOY/edit?usp=sharing) and go to **File > Make A Copy**. Begin inserting your ridden rollercoasters and their respective parks *or* insert their RCDB IDs. These can be found by going to RCDB, searching for the coaster, and copying the number in the URL. For example the URL for Beast at Kings Island is `https://rcdb.com/67.htm` so the ID to be inserted in the spreadsheet is `67`. An initial coaster has already been added as an example.

After inputting all of your rides you wish to track, go to either the "Primary Stats" or "Extended Stats" sheet and hit **Refresh** to begin loading your ride data. The Primary Stats sheet includes some of the most important statistics while not being too overwhelming, while the Extended Stats sheet contains everything you may want to know about a ride.
